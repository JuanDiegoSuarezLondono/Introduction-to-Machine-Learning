## Introduction

We'll begin by introducing you to the fundamentals of pandas, from working with Python native lists and NumPy arrays to understanding the core concept of a Pandas DataFrame. We'll also cover essential concepts like standard aliases.

## Part 1: Getting Started with pandas

Learn the art of creating DataFrames using dictionaries, changing indices, and loading data from various sources, whether it's from a local file, an online resource, or external datasets. We'll delve into DataFrame summaries to better understand your data at a glance.

## Part 2: Overview of Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis

Gain insights into the 'Black Box' metaphor for machine learning and an introduction to statistical analysis. Understand the importance of expected value and variance in data analysis.

## Part 3: The Basics of Using pandas

Get hands-on with practical coding activities, exploring and selecting data in multiple ways using pandas. Engage in discussions about data repositories and enhance your skills in analyzing and visualizing data effectively.

## Part 4: Advanced Data Analysis Techniques

Delve into more advanced techniques, such as division, summation, and percentage calculations. Learn the significance of histograms, understand various data shapes, and identify skewed data and outliers.

## Part 5: Putting Knowledge into Practice

Apply your newfound knowledge by participating in discussions and activities that involve creating visualizations using personally-sourced data.

## Glossary

Finally, we've included a glossary to help you quickly reference any terms or concepts you may encounter along the way.
