    "# Overview: The 'Black Box' Metaphor For Machine Learning\n",
    "Historically, machine learning has been described as a ‘black box’. A ‘black box’ is a box or system in which you cannot see what is happening inside. You can only know what goes in (the inputs) and what comes out (the outputs). Machine learning professionals use this metaphor to describe a statistical model whose operations are so complex that they are not visible to the end-user. As you progress through this program, keep this metaphor in mind as a framework for conceptualizing the possibilities and limitations of machine learning.\n",

    "# Overview: Introduction to Statistical Analysis\n",
    "At its core, statistical analysis is the underlying driver of machine learning and artificial intelligence models. In this section of Module 1, you will be introduced to the concept of probability distribution, which can be defined as all the possible outcomes that a random variable can take within a given range. There are two types of probability distribution: discrete or continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it is important to mention that due to the complexity of machine learning and artificial intelligence problems, a standard, interactive, end-to-end structured approached is essential to make the statistical analysis more functional. The CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), shown in the diagram below, is one of the most popular frameworks in the industry. It includes six key steps: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation and deployment. Keep this in mind as you move through Modules 1 and 2 and build your understanding of statistical analysis and probability. More information wil be provided about the CRISP-DM in Module 3.\n",

    "# Mini-Lesson 1.1: Calculating Expected Value and Variance\n",
    "## Expected value \n",
    "The term expected value means exactly what it sounds like: the result you can expect from some action. It can be calculated by summing the values of a random variable with each value multiplied by its probability of occurrence. Formulaically, expected value is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ∑  -  sum\n",
    "- i   -  index\n",
    "- n  -  total number of possible outcomes\n",
    "- Xi -  value of outcome i\n",
    "- Pi -  probability of observing outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "### An example\n",
    "Consider the scenario where a fair, three-sided die is rolled to obtain a number based upon a random variable. The total number of possible outcomes is three, so n=3. The value of each of the outcomes can only be one, two, or three, and the probability of seeing any specific outcome would be one-third (a three-sided fair die). \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the expected value, you take the first possibility from the die (one) and multiply it by the probability of that result coming up (one-third). Then, you do the same for the other possible results (two multiplied by one-third, and three multiplied by one-third) until all possibilities are exhausted. Once the multiplication is complete, you add the results together to get the expected value. Therefore, your calculation looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/3.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the expected value would be 2 (one-third + two-thirds + 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected variance\n",
    "Utilizing the expected value, you can calculate the long-term average, and since random variables change in each turn, roll, draw, or trial, you understand that these variables will have some type of variation. The formula for calculating expected variance is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/4.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the first example, you now want to calculate the variance based upon a three-sided die. In order to calculate this, you have already found E[X]. You can calculate (E[X])2 as 22 = 4. In order to complete the formula, you now need to solve for E[X2]. This can be calculated in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/5.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step in the process would be to subtract the final equation as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/6.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mini-Lesson 1.2: The Basics of Using pandas\n",
    "As mentioned before, pandas is a top Python library utilized for analyzing data by data scientists and analysts and is the foundation of most data projects. Indeed, it has become one of the preferred libraries for data wrangling or munging for professionals in the ML industry. How does it work? Pandas extracts data from a file like .csv, or any SQL-based database, and creates a Python object of rows and columns called a dataframe. The dataframe looks very similar to a table in a relational database or an Excel spreadsheet. The columns of the dataframe make up what is called a series. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, Widget A is composed of a series. It also includes an auto-generated index column to the left that pandas creates (0, 1, 2, 3). This same structure applies for Widget B. The combination of Widget A and Widget B creates a dataframe with the same index (0, 1, 2, 3) for each series.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/7.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This image depicts Widget A with index, Widget B with index, and a combined dataframe with index.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to create a dataframe in Python. When working with spreadsheet-based files, creating a dataframe is simple if you have already installed the pandas package. If you have not yet installed pandas, complete this pandas installation tutorial Links to an external site..\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, complete the following steps to create a dataframe. The text in **bold italics** is the code you can use to complete each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the pandas library and abbreviate the name by renaming it as pd.\n",
    "    **import pandas as pd**\n",
    "2. Read by default the first spreadsheet of the spreadsheet-based file (i.e. .csv, .xlsx). By reading the spreadsheet using the pandas read_excel module, you will automatically create a dataframe of the Excel file.\n",
    "    **dataframe1 = pd.read_excel(’C:\\\\YourDriveLocation\\SampleFile.xlsx’)** \n",
    "3. Print the dataframe to the screen to examine its content.\n",
    "    **print(dataframe1)**"

    "# Mini-Lesson 1.4: What Are Histograms and Why Do They Matter?\n",
    "In addition to discussing column operations in Video 1.6, Dr. Gomes also shared about plotting in pandas. As a supplement, you can read about a few of the advantages of visualizing your data with histograms in this mini-lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Histograms\n",
    "Histograms are commonly used to visualize the distribution of a single numerical variable. The histogram divides a numeric variable into multiple bins, and these bins calculate the observations that fall into each bin. This columnar representation of binned counts gives you an instant sense of the distribution of values in a variable. Pandas provides a function for this called hist() that generates a histogram per column of numerical data. In data science, histograms are important during exploratory data analysis because they reveal properties about data in ways that summary statistics cannot. Histograms reveal the shape of the data, skewed data, and outliers that might be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data shapes\n",
    "Histograms can assist in determining the symmetry of your dataset. Normally distributed data, which typically has its infamous bell-shaped curve (as in Figure 1), lets you know that your dataset is more analytically appealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/8.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skewed data\n",
    "The identification of skewed data using a histogram is an important factor in determining the suitability of the dataset. Typically, a histogram with skewed data differs from a normal distribution in that one tail seems to drag on longer than the other side. This skew can be to the left (as in Figure 2) or the right. This may require that you perform some data transformation to fit a more normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/9.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outliers\n",
    "Outliers (as in Figure 3) are an important tool when visualizing histograms. Outliers can be explained or unexplained observations, and they may require some type of investigation to understand their legitimacy. Once the investigation of this anomaly has been completed, you can perform some data transformation to fit a more normal distribution.\n",

    "### Domestic Violence in Colombia\n",
    "\n",
    "For my case, I used the dataset of domestic violence in Colombia because I was curious about three different facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which gender had the majority of cases?\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Data Wrangling:** For this value, I simply had to perform the summation of each case based on its gender. As you can observe, there are some cases where the gender of the victim was not reported. Since the 'Gender' value is descriptive rather than quantitative, I decided to use a bar chart to conduct the analysis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Findings:** As can be seen, the majority of reported cases were directed towards female victims in an alarming quantity, almost four times the number of male population. This highlights a clear trend of a population that is being abused (it should be noted that it does not indicate anything about the gender, age, or other characteristics of the perpetrator).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/12.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In which years were there high and low numbers of these cases?\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Data Wrangling:** In this case, I compared the number of cases per year. Since they are temporal measurements, I decided to use a line graph to see if any trend could be visualized. The data did not need to be treated in any special way.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Findings:** This graph shows an increase in the number of cases from 20-40 cases per year to over 120. However, for a period after 2019, there was a significant drop. It is highly probable that the data for that period may not be accurate because, as reported by various media outlets, there was a alarming increase in these cases throughout the country during the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/13.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In which department were these cases more prevalent?\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Data Wrangling:** In this last graph, I resorted once again to a bar chart as it serves the same purpose as the first one. That is, the value to compare is descriptive rather than quantitative, and the number of departments is not large enough to saturate the x-axis of the graph. For the dataset used in this graph, I had to perform the summation of cases reported per department.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Findings:** We can see that places like \"Valle\" or \"Antioquia\" have a much higher number of cases compared to other departments. However, the most notable aspect in this graph is the overwhelmingly large number of cases compared to other departments in \"Cundinamarca\" (which is home to the country's capital). It is interesting to note that the three places with the highest number of cases are neighboring locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/14.png\">\n",

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "It is alarming to see that the number of cases is increasing every year. This indicates that further efforts are needed to raise awareness and educate the population (Especially in areas with a high number of cases like Cundinamarca) about such sensitive issues that undermine the family unit, such as domestic violence. Support must be provided to the victims of these acts, who are mostly women (while not disregarding or undervaluing male victims).\n",
    "Whether it is due to a deeply-rooted cultural issue in Colombia or poor social and emotional management, there is no excuse for not changing these patterns and striving for a more just society where violence, regardless of its gender, is not tolerated at all."

    "- **‘Black Box’:**\n",
    "This is a metaphor for understanding machine learning.\n",
    "- **Continuous Distribution:**\n",
    "This is a distribution in which data can take on any value within a specified range (which may be infinite). Temperature, for instance, can be on a continuum from absolute zero to the surface of the sun, but also, there can be infinite points of data between 12⁰C and 13⁰C, depending on the quality of the thermometer.\n",
    "- **Dataframe:**\n",
    "This is a Python object of rows and columns.\n",
    "- **Discrete Distribution:**\n",
    "This is a distribution in which data can only take on certain values, for example, integers. The recording of the outcomes of a six-sided dice roll would generate a discrete distribution because there are only six possibilities for an outcome.\n",
    "- **Expected Value:**\n",
    "This is the result you can expect from some action. It can be calculated by summing the values of a random variable with each value multiplied by its probability of occurrence.\n",
    "- **Expected Variance:**\n",
    "This is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value.\n",
    "- **Histogram:**\n",
    "The histogram divides a numeric variable into multiple bins, and these bins calculate the observations that fall into each bin. This columnar representation of binned counts gives you an instant sense of the distribution of values in a variable.\n",
    "- **Mean:**\n",
    "The mean is the average of a set of given numbers. For instance, in the given number set [0,1,2,5,6,15,20], the mean would be the sum of all the numbers divided by the count of numbers in the set. The sum of all numbers is 49. There are 7 numbers in the set, so the mean would be 49/7, or 7.\n",
    "- **Median:**\n",
    "The median is the middle number in a set of given numbers. For instance, in the given number set [0,1,2,5,6,15,20], the median would be the middle number, or 5.\n",
    "- **Outliers:**\n",
    "These are explained or unexplained values that lie outside the normal distribution."
